C                                                           
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
G7
In the lane snow is glistening—
 
A beautiful sight, we’re happy tonight,
D7  G7  C
Walking in a winter wonderland.
 
 
C
Gone away is the bluebird,
G7
here to stay is a new bird—
 
He sings a love song as we go along,
D7  G7  C
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 
E  B7  E
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
B7  E
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown.
G7  D7  G7
He’ll say, “Are you married?” We’ll say, “No, man,
A7  D7  G
But you can do the job when you’re in town.”
 
 
G7  C
Later on, we’ll conspire,
 G7
As we dream by the fire
 
To face unafraid the plans that we’ve made
D7  G7  C
Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 
E B7 E
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
B7 E
And pretend that he’s a circus clown.
G7  D7  G7
We’ll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
A7  D7  G
Until the other kids knock him down.
G7  C
When it snows, ain’t it thrilling,
G7
Though your nose gets a-chilling?
 
We’ll frolic and play the Eskimo way,
D7  G7  C
Walking in a winter wonderland.
