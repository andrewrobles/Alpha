C Em
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
F
Dressed in holiday style.
G7 F G7 C
In the air there’s a feeling of Christmas.
Em
Children laughing, people passing,
F
Meeting smile after smile;
G7 C
And on every street corner you hear
 
 
Refrain:
F
Silver bells, silver bells,
G7 C
It’s Christmas time in the city.
F
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
G7  C
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
 
 
Em
Strings of street lights, even stop lights
F
Bling a bright red and green
G7  F  C
As the shoppers run home with their treasures
Em
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch,
F
This is Santa’s big scene
G7  C
And above all the bustle you hear
 
Refrain
