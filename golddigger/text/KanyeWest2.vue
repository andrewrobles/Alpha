Eighteen years, eighteen years<br>
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years<br>
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids<br>
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his<br>
You will see him on TV any given Sunday<br>
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai<br>
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money<br>
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money<br>
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money<br>
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money<br>
If you ain't no punk<br>
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)<br>
It's somethin' that you need to have<br>
'Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half<br>
Eighteen years, eighteen years<br>
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?<br>
