Now, I ain't sayin' you're a gold digger, you got needs<br>
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed<br>
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave<br>
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves<br>
But while y'all washin', watch him<br>
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun<br>
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes<br>
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries<br>
So stick by his side<br>
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice<br>
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl<br>
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl<br>
