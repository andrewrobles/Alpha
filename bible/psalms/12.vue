Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth;<br>
For the faithful fail from among the children of men.<br>
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour:<br>
With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.<br>
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips,<br>
And the tongue that speaketh proud things:<br>
Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;<br>
Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?<br>
For the oppression of the poor,<br>
For the sighing of the needy,<br>
Now will I arise, saith the LORD;<br>
I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.<br>
The words of the LORD are pure words:<br>
As silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.<br>
Thou shalt keep them, O LORD,<br>
Thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.<br>
The wicked walk on every side,<br>
When the vilest men are exalted.
