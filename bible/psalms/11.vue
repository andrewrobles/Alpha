In the LORD put I my trust:<br>
How say ye to my soul, flee as a bird to your mountain?<br>
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string,<br>
That they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.<br>
If the foundations be destroyed,<br>
What can the righteous do?<br>
The LORD is in his holy temple,<br>
The LORD's throne is in heaven:<br>
His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.<br>
The LORD trieth the righteous:<br>
But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.<br>
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest:<br>
This shall be the portion of their cup.<br>
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness;<br>
His countenance doth behold the upright.<br>
